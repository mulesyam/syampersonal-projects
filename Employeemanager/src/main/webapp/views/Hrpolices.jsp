					<h> <b><li>Roles in HR </li>	</b> </h>

					<p>
						HR policies are also defined as that body of principles and rules
						of conduct which govern the enterprise in its relationship with
						employees. Such a policy statement provides guidelines for a wide
						variety of employ­ment relationships in the organization. The
						purpose and significance of the HR policies hardly need any
						elaboration. Every organization needs policies to ensure
						consistency in action and equity in its relation with employees <br>
						<br>

					<h> <b><li> Talent Management
						</li>

						<div class="pull-left">
					</b></h>

					<p>
						The talent management team in the HR department covers a lot of
						ground. What used to be distinct areas of the department have been
						rolled up under one umbrella. The talent management team is
						responsible for recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining
						employees.<br> <br> Recruiters are the heavy lifters in
						building any companyâs workforce. Theyâre responsible for the
						total hiring process including posting positions on job boards,
						sourcing candidates through job fairs and social media, serving as
						the first-line contacts for running background checks to screen
						candidates, conducting the initial interviews, and coordinating
						with the hiring manager responsible for making the final
						selection. A recruiterâs success is determined by several key
						metrics: the number of positions they fill each year, where
						candidates are coming from (e.g., job postings, social media,
						career fairs, etc.), the time it takes to fill positions, and
						reasons why an applicant wasnât hired. (NOTE: If youâre having
						trouble attracting talent to your company, itâs time to evaluate
						why. Take our recruiting quiz to see how you measure up.)<br>
						<br> Employee relations or support is the area of the talent
						management team that is concerned with strengthening the
						employer-employee relationship. Human resources managers in this
						role study job satisfaction, employee engagement, organizational
						culture, and resolving workplace conflict. Gallup estimates that
						disengaged employees cost U.S. businesses a whopping $600+ billion
						each year in lost productivity, so this role is integral to the
						success of your business.<br> <br> If the company has a
						unionized workforce, this team will also work on labor relations,
						including negotiating collective bargaining agreements, creating
						managerial responses to union organizing campaigns, and
						interpreting labor union contract questions.<br> <br>
					</p>

				<h> <li><b>Compensation and Benefits</b></li>
				<p>
					In smaller companies the compensation and benefits roles can often
					be overseen by one or two human resources professionals, but
					companies with a larger workforce will typically split up the
					duties. HR functions in compensation include evaluating the pay
					practices of competitors and establishing the compensation
					structure. The compensation department is also responsible for
					creating job descriptions in tandem with department managers, as
					well as working with talent management on succession planning.<br>
					<br> On the benefits side, HR practitioners are typically
					responsible for functions such as negotiating group health coverage
					rates with insurance carriers or coordinating with the companyâs
					401(k) administrator. Of course, payroll is also part of the
					compensation and benefits area of HR, but many companies choose to
					outsource this function to a bookkeeper or payroll service
					provider. Those that donât generally put payroll practitioners in a
					separate team that works on the tactical process of generating
					payroll, with the compensation team focusing mainly on planning and
					strategy.<br><br>


				</p>
				</h>
				<h><li> <b> Training and Development </b></li> </h>
				
				<p>Every company wants to see its employees thrive, which means
					providing them with all the tools they need to succeed. These tools
					arenât necessarily physical such as laptops, job-related software,
					or tools for a particular trade; they can include new employee
					orientation, leadership training programs, personal and
					professional development, and managerial training. Training and
					development (sometimes called learning and development) is an
					integral part of the HR team. Depending on the type of employee
					role played at the company, the training team might be responsible
					for building out instructional programs that have a direct effect
					on the success of the business. Today, many colleges and
					universities offer degrees in training and development; an
					instructional design degree would also be helpful in this role.</p>

				<br><br>
				<h> <li><b>HR Compliance</b> </li></h>
				<p>
					Legal and regulatory compliance is a critical component of any HR
					department. Employment and labor laws are highly complex, and
					having a team devoted to monitoring this ever-changing landscape is
					essential to keeping companies out of trouble with federal, state,
					and local governmentsâ laws. When a business is out of compliance,
					it can result in applicants or employees filing claims based on
					discriminatory hiring and employment practices or hazardous working
					conditions. The compliance practitioner or team must fully
					understand employment laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act
					(FLSA), the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Title VII of the Civil
					Rights Act of 1964, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, and
					dozens of other rules and regulations.<br> <br> The HR
					compliance team is also heavily involvedâworking in tandem with
					other HR practitionersâin developing all company policy that makes
					up the employee handbook.<br><br>
				</p>
				<h> <li><b> Workplace Safety </b> </li></h>
				<p>Of course, every company wants to provide a safe place to
					work for its employees, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act
					of 1970 (OSHA) actually mandates that employers provide a safe
					working environment for their workers. A large focus area for HR is
					developing and supporting safety training and maintaining federally
					mandated logs in the event injuries or fatalities happen at work.
					In addition, this department often works hand-in-hand with benefits
					specialists to manage the companyâs Workersâ Compensation filings.<br><br>
